## Problem statement

Businesses or companies can fall prey to default if they are not able to keep up their debt obligations. Defaults will lead to
a lower credit rating for the company which in turn reduces its chances of getting credit in the future and may have to pay
higher interests on existing debts as well as any new obligations. From an investor's point of view, he would want to invest
in a company if it is capable of handling its financial obligations, can grow quickly, and is able to manage the growth scale. Therefore, I built a model
to predict whether a company would default on its loan or not

## Characteristics of the data
In this project, I have utilised ML methods to predict whether a company would default on its loan or not. We were given the financial parameters of 3586 companies
and I had 65 features to work with. Some of the features were:

1. Networth
2. Capital Employed
3. Gross sales
4. PBDT
5. PBIT
6. PAT
7. Current assets
8. Latest fixed assets ratio

## Key insights from the analysis

1. A classification model was built which had an accuracy of 88%, Precision for positive class i.e., default class 48%, recall of 76%, and F1-score of 59%
2. About 50% of defaulters have less than 0 net working capital
3. About 75% of defaulters have negative rate of growth for net worth as compared to just 25% of nondefaulters having negative rate of growth for net worth
4. Average number of days required for receiving the payments for non-defaulters is 75 and average number of
days required for receiving the payments for non-defaulters is 77. But Average number of days non-defaulters
takes to pay suppliers is 58, on the other hand average number of days defaulters take to pay supplier
